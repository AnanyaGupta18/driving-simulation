# driving-simulation
The Driving Simulation System is a Java-based console application that simulates essential car driving operations such as starting the engine, shifting gears, accelerating, and applying brakes. The project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, control flow, and real-time interaction using user inputs.
